## 👋 Hi, I'm Gazi!

🙋‍♂️ I’m a rising junior at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/). I'm currently pursuing a dual-degree in Statistics (BS) and Mathematical Economic Analysis (BA) with minors in Data Science and Financial Computation & Modelling. You can probably find me studying for classes, planning for the annual Rice Datathon, playing around with my camera, or just haning out with friends!

📫 You can reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gazifuad/)!
